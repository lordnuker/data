        "description": "Mara stared at the Wall of Wishes. She had no more bargains to make. Her plans were in motion.\n\nThere was nothing left but the wait.\n\nShe pulled a sidearm from a hidden holster and cracked a dozen rounds into the Wall.\n\nThe cosmic balance shifted. Somewhere in the Dreaming City, Riven heard the Queen's wish and a thousand shrieking tears in reality cut through the space in front of her.\n\nLord Shaxx suddenly blocked Mara's view of the Wall.\n\n\"â€”YES, AND WE'D ALL BE DEAD!\" He was screaming at no one, with a mug of caffeine in his fist.\n\nHe started, almost spilling his coffee. \"Where are we?\"\n\nMara slapped the mug out of his hand. It shattered on the floor. She shoved a weathered book in his face. \"I told you there would come a time when I collect for the Reef Wars. Read this. Out loud.\"\n\n\"No one tells me what to do,\" he said, grabbing the book and incinerating it in a bolt of Striker lightning. \"I can recite The Tempest by heart.\" And he did. Mara sat and listened. They stayed for a long time. \n\nThe helmet stayed on.",
