I had intended it to be an asset to her, a means to faster preparation with her armory of weapons, a place to store additional tools, and allow her to enter combat with the ergonomics of a \"standard\" soldier.\n\nShe told me she preferred it because it gave her enemies a fair shot at her head. I enjoyed her company immensely.\n\n—Calus, Emperor of the Cabal",
