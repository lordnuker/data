It seeks to link to the synaptic patterns of the closest organism, living or synthetic, to form an unbreakable bond. We theorize that this bond is a form of primordial ‘love'—an emotional connection meant to compel the bio-matter to view its host as ‘family.' The host comes to regard the bio-matter as an indispensable tool. \n\nThe science is inexact, but what is known is that the bio-matter becomes aggressively protective once linked to a worthy host, forming an organic shell that can amplify the host's own strength when immediate threats are detected. \n\n—Self-authored report broadcast on covert frequencies",
