Too kind.\"\n\n\"You're sure the transmat range will cover my entire territory?\"\n\n\"And then some, if the rumors are true.\"\n\n\"Now now, there's no need for that.\"\n\nOlu gives a jaunty curtsy. \"Are you sure I can't interest you in some arsenic lipstick?\"\n\n\"It looks better on you than it ever would on me, my friend.\"\n\n\"Your loss, of course. Your loss.\" Olu offers her hand. \"Shake on it?\"\n\nSpider extends his arm—pauses before their appendages touch.
