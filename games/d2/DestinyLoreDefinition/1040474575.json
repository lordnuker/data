They also serve as a reminder— a reminder of what you are. \n\nYou are a Titan. The wall against which evil breaks. The candle in the darkest of these days. The protector of the Traveler's last gifts. \n\nThis City is your home. Its people are your blood. And its walls are your shields, your weapons, your temple. \n\nTake your place, Titan, and know this: when you fight for the Last City, you will never suffer defeat. \n\n– Zavala, Titan Vanguard",
