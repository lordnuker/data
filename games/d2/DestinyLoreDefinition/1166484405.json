		"description": "\"I can get it open,\" Felspring said, as Felwinter pried open two rusted metal doors with his hands. \"You don't have to do that.\"\n\nThe metal screamed as Felwinter ripped the two doors back. They were deep underground in a bunker Felspring had struggled for six days to locate. Now that they'd found it, Felwinter realized he didn't know what they were looking for.\n\n\"I don't know very much about Rasputin,\" Felspring said, floating cautiously beside him. \"I thought he was deactivated. Or destroyed in the Collapse.\"\n\nFelwinter walked forward. The room was like a time capsule: untouched, preserved, as if technicians might walk in at any time to work the control panels lining the walls. It reminded him of the library where he'd woken up, just in its complexity andâ€¦ maybe beauty. Was this beautiful? He wasn't sure.\n\n\"So why would a Warmind be after us?\" Felwinter muttered.\n\nFelspring hovered to examine a flat, black surface on one of the control panels. \"I don't know.\"\n\nFelwinter came up beside her. He hesitated, and then reached to touch the shiny, blank surface of the panel. It blinked to life under his hand, bright code and controls glowing orange, rearranging themselves as he dragged his finger across them.\n\n\"How did you do that?\" Felspring whispered.\n\nFelwinter shook his head. He touched another blank panel and lights came on all over the bunker, waking it up.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said.",
