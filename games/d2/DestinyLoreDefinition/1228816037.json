He would remember that snake when he realized he needed a symbol to motivate the masses in another lifetime. For a game he called Gambit.\n\nIt was before the rise of the place humanity would come to call the Last Safe City. He was a true drifter floating from place to place like smoke. Some people had taken to calling him Drifter. He had many names, and he went by none of them.\n\nShe knew him then as Eli. And the second time he met her, he asked, \"Would you like to dance before you go?\"\n\n\"Not now,\" she had said.\n\n\"Wait, what did you think I said?\" he asked.\n\n\"Would you like to dance?\" she repeated.\n\n\"I would love to,\" he said, and stepped forward with his arms in the air.\n\nShe chuckled.\n\nHe paused.\n\n\"This has never worked before,\" he said.\n\nHe joined her in the Pilgrim Guard. They fought alongside each other. He saved her life. She saved his.\n\nHe was convinced she was his best friend.\n\nHe was wrong. One day, he never saw her again.\n\nNot as she was.",
