		"description": "MCXXIX, forthcoming.\nRecorded by Underscribe Shipal\n\nThus did the Shadow of Earth slay Cayde-7.\n\nThen a visitor approached the throne of the Joyous Emperor and proffered himself before the Generous Host. He was Cayde-7, whose origins are recounted in MCXXXVII. ^\n\nCayde-7 knelt at the Emperor's feet, and kissed his boots, saying: \"Your truest servant is here.\"\n\nAnd the Emperor was pleased, for he thought that this one would make a very fine Shadow.\n\nBut the true Shadow of Earth, jealous of the Emperor's love, cut down Cayde-7 where he stood in the Emperor's throne room, and then dealt with his ruins in such a way as to ensure that there would never be a Cayde-8.\n\nThe Emperor was pleased, and that night there was a great feast aboard the Leviathan.\n\n\n\n^ A note to Underscribe Shipal: Entry MCXXXVII appears to be missing. Please reattach it to this account, and delete this footnote upon rectifying this error.",
