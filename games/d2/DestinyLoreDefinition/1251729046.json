The more I fight it, the more it fights me.\n\n\"I choose to let it lead. \n\n\"It finds the milky cores and bursts them with a satisfying combustion, radiolarian fluid glinting in the light. It guides me as I support it. \n\n\"We work in tandem, a brilliant dance of destruction, leaving nothing but ruin in our wake.  Nothing can stop this union.\"\n\nâ€”Saint-14",
