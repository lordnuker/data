Think about that. And then know that you will one day know the answers to all of them. \nYou are a Warlock. Your armor is wisdom, your weapons wit and ingenuity. You hold the power to draw strength from the places where imagination and possibility collide. \nThe universe is a complex machine. But all machines can be understood, taken apart, modified, improved. \nAll you have to do is look. \n\n—Ikora Rey",
