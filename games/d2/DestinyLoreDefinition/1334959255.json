Time vanished us like it does memories. \nBut in the darkest days of the Dark Ages, when humanity was utterly defenseless, Arcstriders disciplined their bodies to let the Traveler's energy flow through them, to call lightning itself to hand and wield it like a staff against the Darkness. \nBecome the Lightning, they said.  \nNo. \nBecome the staff, they said. \nNo. \nBecome a weapon, they said.  \nWe obliged.",
