They lead far away from here, across a vast, white expanse, disappearing into infinity.\n\nWe tied those ribbons. To see what you would do.\n\nSo that we could learn. About you. And this system.\n\nIt was our Emissary's idea.\n\nSecond contact. We have learned since then.\n\nThe heavens above you are clear of stars and shadows.\n\nYour soul is weary.\n\nYour feet find purchase on a three-dimensional plane.\n\nYour bond's glow is dim; there is no Light here. Or Dark.",
