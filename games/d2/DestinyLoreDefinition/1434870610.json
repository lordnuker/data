If this story isn't a sham, a Shadow of your Titan-tribe would be perfect for replacing Gahlran. I need someone hearty like you to carry the Crown in his place.\n\nWill you wear it when I ask you? Because the day will come.\n\nYou don't have to answer right now. Think about it. And take this helm in its place for now.",
