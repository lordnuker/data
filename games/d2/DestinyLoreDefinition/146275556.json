Eris had seen wish-dragons drive Titans mad by refusing to fall to brute strength. But Eris was pretty sure Wei-Ning was already insane.\n\n\"Confession time,\" the Titan said, as she hammered punches into the Ahamkara's tentacled face. \"I've been wishing this fight would go on forever.\"\n\nEris balked. \"Please stop, you psychopath.
