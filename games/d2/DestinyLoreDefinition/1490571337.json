When a seer shares their knowledge of a coming event—any event, whether good or ill—there will always be those who gather to prevent it. Say too little and your meaning is lost. Say too much and you have made the task of your enemies easier. You must say just enough so that the few who can listen will hear.\n\nI have done all I can. The rest is up to you. You must trust in me.\n\nYou must trust in yourself.\n\n—Osiris",
