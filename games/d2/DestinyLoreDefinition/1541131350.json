Not 'cause I wanted to sell it. Just 'cause it'd feel good to know.\n\nThen I was gonna take a little vacation with it to Venus, and THEN I'd figure out what to do with it. At my leisure.\n\nBut no. Had to get sucker punched by an asteroid.\n\nBarely made the landing on this dusty spit of Shore. Lost all my weapons in the crash. Heart only survived 'cause I put it in my helmet and buckled it in my seat.\n\nSo my Ghost revives me, and there I am in a crater surrounded by fragmentalized auto rifles and a Golden Age microstellar dynamo. Talk about hell.\n\nI started with three barrels. Figured I might as well lean into the hell vibe. Shoulda known that wouldn't have been enough to really min/max with a power source this feisty. Especially once I noticed the coronal containment shield was cracked.\n\nThe first time I fired the Cerberus+1 and felt that puppy kick, I knew: plans are overrated.",
