It had gone quiet when the Red Legion attacked. She answered it with trembling fingers.\n\"I know,\" she said. \"I can see it. I can feel it.\"\n\"Even the stars are brighter now,\" said the voice over the radio. \"The whole cosmos is ablaze.\"\nShe closed her eyes. \"I can't wait to see it. I'm coming home. Efrideet out.\"",
