Forever.\n\nFor you and all those like you.\n\nBut the Dark has returned.\n\nAnd when Light and Dark meet, universes collapse.\n\nNot something to mourn. Natural order.\n\nBut we believe you exist to buck natural order. You always did. Even before the Dark.\n\nBefore the Light.\n\nWhen it was just you. And those like you.\n\nWe would learn more.\n\nThe heavens above you are clear of stars and shadows.\n\nYour feet find purchase on a three-dimensional plane.\n\nYour bond's glow is dim; there is no Light here. Or Dark.",
