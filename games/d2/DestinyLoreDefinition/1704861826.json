Pre-Golden Age, we think. Linde's best guess is that it was part of a moving art exhibit.\"\n\n\"You tell me nothing I do not already know.\"\n\n\"But… why do you want it?\"\n\nSpider might have let the man live, up until now.\n\nA pity, really.\n\n\"All you need to know is how much I will pay you if you bring it to me.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Howe says dubiously. \"Give me a hundred hours.\"\n\n\"You have forty.\"\n\nSpider ends the call, and begins the process of wiping it from the records.",
