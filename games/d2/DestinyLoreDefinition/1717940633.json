WE ARE SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. AND LESS.\n\n\"The armor you found in ontological space—it's giving off the same energy signature I picked up when you asked the Nine about the nature of the Dark!\"\n\nYour Ghost grips tighter as the wind whips your cloak, rippling it like a kite.\n\n\"I think that question produced an ontological effect—one that hasn't fully resolved!\"\n\nTHE LIGHT DESTROYS. GUARDIANS DESTROY. BUT GHOSTS REBUILD. THEY ARE A TANGENTIAL EXPRESSION WITHIN THE COMMON EQUATION.\n\n\"They're still trying to answer the question!\"\n\nA harsh glare blooms from the heavens above.\n\nSomething grips your hands, desperately shaking them.\n\nYour soul is weary.\n\nYour feet find purchase in shifting sands.",
