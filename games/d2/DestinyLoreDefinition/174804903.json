No different from the one you carry in your pocket. \nORIN: You're all either very brave or very foolish. \nG-6: You sound like Shaxx. \nG-5: She does. I'm glad my charge is gone. \nG-4: Don't say that. \nG-5: It's true. \nG-4: Don't say it out loud. Some of us go our whole lives without finding one. Show some respect. \nG-5: Don't talk like you're better than me. You're in here, too. \nORIN: Please. I'm sorry to call you all here, but— \nG-2: You're not sorry. \nORIN: I need to know what you found out there. \nG-9: Nothing. \nORIN: At least give me the coordinates.",
