But let's just say flying around in a restored Golden Age relic tends to attract a certain… criminal element.\nI'm currently in the [redacted] system looking for some replacement ion rotors.

I tried to be diplomatic, but before I knew it one of those [redacted] boltheads drew on me. Let's just say he won't be putting together any fine machinery for a while.\nI managed to reassemble everything in under [redacted] hours; I've gotten to know her guts pretty well.
