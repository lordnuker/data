Rasputin is satisfied. Complete. It regards itself as the pinnacle of creation. It doesn't want to be equal, or stand around a table and banter. It wants to be better, and we've programmed it to get what it wants. That's the nature of the machine.\n\nC6: Of THAT machine.\n\nZ: The problem with Rasputin is that we made it what it is, we modeled it, and it learned well.\n\nC6: So you don't trust machines, but *I'm* OK 'cause I'm one of the good ones. That's not very generous, boss.\n\nZ: I don't remember saying that you were OK.\n\nC6: â€¦\n\nZ: What?\n\nC6: IKORA! ZAVALA MADE A JOKE! You're not Ikora. Where's Ikora? IKORA!",
