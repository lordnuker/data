Project Niobe. Helga's great experiment to make our weapons more deadly through a sort of on-the-spot phase transition of the guns. In other words, a walking, talking forge.\n\nYears ago, it was just an idea. Now, it's a reality. Seeing the Exo discover her ability was… well, thrilling. It was nice to feel something other than dread for a few minutes. And a few minutes was about all we got.\n\nWe were sloppy. While the Exo practiced using her ability, we were ambushed by… I don't even know what they were.\n\nThey were definitely not regular Humans. They had… abilities. That the rest of us don't. We took one down, we thought. But then his little red drone lit up and he was on his feet again.\n\nWe kept firing. They didn't expect to run into an armory on foot, so they ran.\n\nBut not before killing some of us and wounding Yuki.\n\nShe promises I'm still stuck with her, though. I'd be lost without her.\n\n---\n\nEntry 105\n\nWe traveled all night to put as much distance between us and our attacker as possible.\nThe Exo is carrying Yuki now. It's clear she doesn't have long.\n\nShe's asked me to leave her behind.\n\nThis family is all we have left. We will do no such thing.",
