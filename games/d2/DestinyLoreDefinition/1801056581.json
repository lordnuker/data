        "description": "Entry 108\n\nYuki… is dead. It didn't happen like I thought it would.\n\nOne of the men who had attacked us returned. This time with an offer. He wanted the Exo. He had seen what she was capable of back at the truck. How she turned our weapons into something even more deadly with nothing but her hands.\n\nThe Exo stood, willing to sacrifice herself for us.\n\nI was horrified, but before I could say anything, Yuki lied and said she had the Obsidian Accelerator. That it was in her backpack.\n\nThe man approached her cautiously as she quickly looked at me. That one last look. The same one that had calmed me down so many times. She reached for the backpack as the man drew near.\n\nThe Exo grabbed me and gave me cover as the grenade exploded, shielding me from the flaming shrapnel. Then she helped me up and we ran. I looked back once.\n\nThe man's red drone was shining its terrible light about the carnage looking for its master.\n\nHe'll get up again. He knows what she can do.\n\nHe will be looking for us.\n\nYuki… I'm so sorry.\n\n---\n\nEntry 109\n\nThree days later. Still numb. It's unbearable.\n\nIt's just me and her now.\n\n---\n\nEntry 110\n\nShe and I spent the night under the wing of a crashed jet. I realize now as I write this that I haven't seen a plane in the sky. Not once since we set out. This is not the world I knew.\n\nEvery time I look at her, I'm thinking about it. This is not the world I knew.",
