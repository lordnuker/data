I should have listened to Helga and Yuki.\n\nThis is bigger than just me. It's about all of us.\n\nIf Project Niobe can help Humanity, then it's our duty to press forward with it.\n\nEven if it means working closely with some unsavory types… sometimes that's the cost of protection.\n\nIt's only a matter of time now.\n\n---\n\nEntry 68\n\nThey are here. They are real.\n\nI can't believe we were so… right.\n\n…and so wrong. To think that we could stop this. To say we were naïve would be an understatement.\n\nWe simply didn't know. Their power. Their strength.\n\nIt's insurmountable.\n\nAs they draw closer, all we can do is hide and hope that the facility doors will be strong enough. It's utter chaos out there.\n\nToo many put their faith in the Traveler. I don't know what sort of answers people expect from a gigantic ball in the sky. It remains silent, as always.\n\nAt least I'm with her. Being with family is what matters in the end.\n\nThere is no more hope.\n\nOnly the screams of humanity.",
