At eleven, she was the oldest of the group.\n\n\"Mr. Kringle,\" said Kasim, who had been reading all about pre-Collapse traditions. \"Every Dawning, Kringle visits the good children of the City. He comes at night, while you're asleep, and leaves presents in your house.\"\n\n\"But the door's locked because of prowlers,\" Tomas said.\n\n\"He slithers down the chimney,\" Kasim said. Or was it 'slides'?\n\n\"How does he fit?\" asked Matsuko, the youngest.\n\n\"Well.\" Kasim hesitated. \"He's magic…\" \n\n\"So he's a Guardian,\" Runa said.\n\n\"No, he's not a Guardian.\"\n\nThe children exchanged looks and erupted into nervous chatter. \n\n\"If there's a fire in the fireplace, can he still get in?\" Tomas asked, alarmed.\n\n\"He can't get hurt by the fire.\" Kasim was losing steam. \"Listen.
