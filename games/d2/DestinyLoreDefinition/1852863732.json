        "description": "From the makers of the Coldheart comes the latest in breakthrough City Age technology: the Wavesplitter. Here are the three most frequently asked questions we get about our revolutionary weaponized sound system.\n\nQ: If the Wavesplitter fires sound waves, does it need ammo packs?\n\nA: The Wavesplitter does need ammo packs, but the onboard matter transmuter turns that ammo into electrical energy that powers the waveform emitter.\n\nQ: What does it sound like when you're hit by it?\n\nA: Our Guardian testers give us many different answers. Some say it sounds like a scream you hear in your bones. Others say it sounds like a dying star. Still others say it reminds them of a knife shaped like a B flat.\n\nQ: Can the Wavesplitter be used as a musical instrument?\n\nA: The Wavesplitter was not designed to be a musical instrument. That said, we at Omolon are in the business of giving Guardians options, not taking them away.",
