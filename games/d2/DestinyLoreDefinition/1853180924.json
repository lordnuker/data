Anyone who was listening could.\n\nHe waits for a response and I do as well, tense, curious. He stands attentively, this loyal dog of a man. It is no time at all for me, but for him, the hours creep by in silence.\n\nI am ready to choke the voice of his Traveler if it answers him, but there is nothing.

Hope bleeds from him. He gives the messenger a token of his faith. They accept it without understanding its meaning.\n\nHe watches as they leave. There is a hollow place in his center. It is beautiful.\n\n**\n\nI return warily.\n\nI do not see him, but I hear him. He speaks to all with a voice thick with grief. \n\nI must learn how far I have been set back. I reach to him tentatively. Strength. I pushâ€”and feel only sweet, soft rot. \n\nI am delirious with pleasure.
