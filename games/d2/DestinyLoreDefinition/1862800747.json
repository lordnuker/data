I go around touting that name and those mercs will come out of their caves and I'll have twice the trouble.

Been in the wilds for decades, and word is they've made a new pact with the City, so there's bound to be more of them.” \n“It's just a name.” \n“You tell them that, they'll probably put a bounty on you and try to sacrifice you to their forge. I'll call them Sunbracers.” \n“Call them what you want. To me they'll always be Sunbreakers.”",
