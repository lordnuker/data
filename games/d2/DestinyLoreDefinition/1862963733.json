If you haven't, you must.\n\nAnd true, it is a place of recreation for my beloved soldiers, but did you know that they are born there? Yes, the joyful, axe-wielding ceremonial bathers are but seconds into their lives when you cut them down.\n\nThey are created from genetic patterns of the most virile martial artists of a bygone Cabal era.\n\nAnd Gahlran, the Sorrow-Bearer, was once one of them.
