		"description": "Joy wells in her heart when her searching fingers trace the edges of Eleusinia.\n\nShe has passed through the desert. She has reached the far side of the chessboard. She is alive, or soon will be.\n\nShe opens the door and her joy dies on the threshold.\n\nHer throne world is desecrated.\n\nNot annihilated, as Oryx's was. The pillars and terraces and courtyards still retain their shape. But the roots have rotted, and the geometry festers.\n\nShe should have known she would not be the only one to plan for such eventualities.\n\nOryx's bootprints pucker like scars in the labyrinth that was once only her own.\n\nShe sits a while beneath Sjur's statue, then follows his tracks through the ruins of Eleusinia, back to the Dreaming City.",
