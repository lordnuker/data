His opponent was warning him to stay put. He keyed his radio. \"But you didn't kill him, Randy. Now he knows where we are. I'm pinned down! Wait for everyone else to catch upâ€”\"\nThe sky fell. Redrix only heard it when he felt it, every atom of his body dissolving as a bolt from the blue sky blasted a crater into the earth. His emerging fireteam was caught in the wake.\nTheir ghosts brought them all back in staccato bursts of Light.\nLord Shaxx beckoned them into the crater he had made.\n\n\"Make take,\" Redrix said. His fireteam and Shaxx all stared.\n\"Make take,\" Redrix tried again. His Ghost frowned, and ran a beam of Light across Redrix's chassis.\n\"How many of these tests are you going to make us take?\" Redrix managed. His Ghost nodded.\n\"Just the one,\" Shaxx said. \"Spread the word. Starting today, the Crucible is ranked. And you've all just been seeded. Go make history.\"",
