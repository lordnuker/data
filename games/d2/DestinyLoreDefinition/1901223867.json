        "description": "The Hive left the Crown of Sorrow on one of their war moons, and my Shadows waged such a campaign to take it. We did. And we converted it into an Athenaeum world.\n\nBut the Crown was a trap. A trap for me. I suspected as much.\n\nWhich is why I did not wear it.\n\nAfter initial tests, my Psions determined it was a seeing device of sorts, feeding all sorts of data to someone or something deep in the Ascendant Plane.\n\nBut seeing devices look both ways. I had to have it. And I had to have someone wear it.\n\nBecause I believed I could control the Hive through a Shadow surrogate. The Hive are not true darkness, not what I saw at the black edge. But they would provide an army just the same.\n\nProud Gahlran was bred specifically to bring them under my control.",
