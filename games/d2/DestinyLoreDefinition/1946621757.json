Analyze it for additional traps.\n\nYou've worn Hive armor before. The hides of both the Taken King and his son.\n\nThose did not whisper, did not sap your will.\n\nThis Crown was willing to share power, where the armor of the King left nothing real behind for you to take. Because the King takes.\n\nThe Crown of Sorrow is more charitable. Giving. TOO giving. Because what it gives is infection. Gahlran thought he could overcome it. You saw the result.\n\nI thank you for freeing him. He's in a better place now. A place we're all going, when the black edge closes in on us.\n\n—Emperor Calus",
