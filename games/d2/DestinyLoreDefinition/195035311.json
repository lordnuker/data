He is talking silent singing.\n\n^K^KV^V^V^V^V\n\n(Watch your six don't worry about me grow grow grow)\n\nHe holsters his gun to gesture he holsters his gun to drink his gun is rusted into its holster and he will never pull it out again.\n\n(How bad can it be how bad can it be how can we grow grow grow)\n\nA Titan is a Wall a Shield a Cup filling itself to overflowing. The container changes the shape of its contents but the contents change the nature of the container and the nature is eternity.\n\n(Who knows what's listening it's listening it's saying grow grow grow)\n\nThere is a shape that is his mind and the shape is protect the shape is sacrifice the shape is (grow)\n\n^V^V^V^V^V\n\nHe was named too well he is his own grave and the cut on his left hand will never heal.",
