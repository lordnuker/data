Do that, regardless of all the rest, and that's honor right there. And, let me tell ya, kid…\n\nHonor matters. It's a weapon in its own right. And a shield. Zavala knows. Ikora knows. Saladin and Shaxx, they probably know a little too much. All the best Guardians know.\n\nPeople trust your word, they'll trust you. And trust? It's hard to come by and easy to lose. Give your word. Keep your word. And when all else fails, you'll find you have friends there to pick up the slack.\n\nEven if you don't. You find yourself all alone, odds stacked, final curtain set to drop—at least you can go out knowing you did the right thing when it was asked.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. The \"right thing,\" like honor, can be a malleable concept. It shifts and bends.\n\nI'm getting poetic here. \"Waxin' Warlock,\" we called it. Not my intent, but sometimes I can see the value in their thinkin'—their way with words. Ah, look at that: there's another lesson…\n\nFind value in another.\n\nI don't have much in common with a ramrod Titan or a floofy Warlock, but that's the key.",
