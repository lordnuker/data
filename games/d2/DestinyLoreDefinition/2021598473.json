Gotta start over. How long was that one, Failsafe?\"\n\n\"Two hundred thirty-six seconds since the last teleportation! You never told me that Ace was your son! How wonderful!\"(\"And super sad.\")\n\n\"That's the theory. Saw the name in a journal in my pocket when my Ghost first rezzed me. Seemed as likely as anything else.\"\n\n\"So you don't know if your son truly exists?\" (\"That's super-duper sad.\")\n\n\"Nope. But you don't know what happened to your crew. Does it change how you feel about 'em?\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" (\"But they're still dead.\")\n\n\"There you go. Now do me a favor and start the recording again, will ya? Not sure h—\"\n\n\"Cayde unit, I have great news! A ship similar to yours has entered the gravitational radius of this planetoid!\"\n\n\"What?! All right! Uh-oh. Listen, the next teleport's about to happen. Don't tell them that I got in over my head, OK? Tell them it was some kind of Vex trap or something. Got it? Failsafe?\"",
