ONE OF THE REASONS WE COVET OUR TIME WITH YOU.\n\nWhat are L I G H T and D A R K without you, and all those like you, to drive T H E M?\n\nN O T H I N G.\n\nThe heavens above you are clear of stars and shadows.\n\nYour hands are bound in red ribbons.\n\nYour soul is weary.\n\nYour bond's glow is dim; there is no Light here.
