        "description": "She was the first Ghost to arrive, but it wasn't long until there were dozens of them, scanning every pile of debris that remained of Tower North. They came in search of the one who guided their journeys, the one who once spoke for the Traveler.\n\n\"He called me Dejana. Before I met him, I didn't know what to call myself.\" She was speaking to a red-shelled one, who hovered where the Speaker once studied the Light. His eyes were ever fixed on the new brilliance of the Living Traveler.\n\n\"He called me Anwar. You never found yours either, did you?\"\n\n\"No.\" Her journey had spanned centuries—on Earth, the Moon, and Venus—but she never unearthed a single soul she felt worthy of the Light. \"I used to think it was me; perhaps I was too picky, but… he assured me, humanity was vast. The gift of the Light must be deserved, and it was better to be thorough than to end up with someone too weak to bear the burden, or worse, misuse it. He, at least, made me feel… useful. I put my search on hold and served him as a cartographer. You?\"\n\n\"Deconstructionist.\" Anwar paused. Drifted a few feet toward the luminous Living Traveler. \"Dejana, can you feel it?\"\n\nDejana followed Anwar's gaze up to the Traveler. \"Feel what?\"\n\n\"The pressure.\"",
