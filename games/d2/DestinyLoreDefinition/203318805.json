That sounds like you're a thing.\"\n\n\"You're insufferable, do you know that?\"\n\n\"You didn't have to bring me back.\"\n\n\"You know that's not true.\"\n\n\"Is it?\"\n\n\"There you go again, Tyra, questioning everything. Treating the entire world like a puzzle that you have to record, and analyze, and put in your files.\"\n\n\"I cannot do anything else. If I do not question, do not study, do not learn, I have no purpose. 'Every mind has its own form.'\"\n\n\"You've been reading philosophy again.\"\n\n\"Rousseau. Ikora lent me a copy.\"\n\n\"Hmmph.\"\n\n\"Don't pout, Ghost. It's annoying.\"\n\n\"So is being called Ghost. Might as well cover me with a sheet.\"\n\n\"Choose your own name. You don't need me to define you.\"\n\n\"I will!\"\n\n… … …\n\n\"Well? What is your name, Ghost?\"\n\n\"Don't call me Ghost.\"",
