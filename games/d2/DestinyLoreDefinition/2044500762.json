They are a fireteam.\n\n\"After Cybele,\" the Warlock says, \"the Wolves bowed. Some became the Queen's bodyguards. Then, Skolas—\"\n\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa. How? Why?\" The Hunter frowns. \"Why trust enemies with your life?\" A pause. \"No offense, buddy.\"\n\nThe Captain shrugs: none taken. \"Eia. Strange to do. But Eliksni… we been breathe-always love for honor. New promise not unmake an old. Wolves would been follow Marakel forever if Skolas does not appear again.\"\n\nThe passage widens, and they find a hidden door veneered with amethyst. The Captain lays a hand on it, bows his head. The Hunter and the Warlock fall back respectfully. After a time, the Warlock ventures, \"Mithrax?\"\n\nThe Captain turns. \"Wolves rebel. Now, Wolves extinct. This where-live mine-things scatter must end. I will Kell the mind-open Eliksni. No spider-tricks. No loyal-lies. Variisis truths. We fight for Great Machine together.\"",
