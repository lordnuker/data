Don't shut anything down until you get the whole picture.\"\n\n\"Seems like the picture's the problem.\"\n\n\"OK. Listen—the details aren't important. I just want a good gun that you take out and the fight's already over.\" He shoots at invisible opponents. \"Tsuu-tsuu-tsuu! The end.\"\n\nBanshee relaxes.
