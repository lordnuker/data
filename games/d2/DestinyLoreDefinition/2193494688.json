None of them expected to survive their mission. The might of the Red Legion had grown vast. This acceptance brought them together. \n\nThe Fulminator didn't understand, or care. As long as Calus left the Arkborn to their interstellar conduits, she would do what she had done since the day she came aboard the Leviathan: destroy the enemies of the emperor.",
