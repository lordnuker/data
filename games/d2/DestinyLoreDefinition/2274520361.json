She has implied that I use the space between words to make [bargains] to my advantage.\n\nHow dare she.\n\nShe knows me so well.\n\nWhat [the Queen] wants, the Techeun move worlds to obtain. And so the Witches devise an impossible machine that speaks a visual language with very few spaces between its words. This machine speaks [wishes]. Makes [bargains].\n\nThe Wall of [Wishes], it is called.\n\nIf the Techeun's design proves correct, it will be difficult for me to interpret the [wishes] made at the Wall to my advantage. But challenges entice me.\n\nI look upon the Wall. Upon the Witches' visual language for [bargains]. For me, it is a menu of delights to feast upon.",
