Procuring a modal sample from the Hive and comparing it to their runic syntax might be key to its graphemics and, ultimately, ambages to the protological patterns underlying quantum field theory, relativity, and paracausal phenomena.\n[silence]\n[a:02] A comparative study of Hive hymnody and graphonomy might—as part of a larger cerebrative process examining engrams through the window of fundamental theories of reality—reveal an ungirding pattern of tonal morphemes that…\n[a:03] Hmm.\n[silence]\n[a:04] Both causal and paracausal laws of the universe might… share a common… language.
