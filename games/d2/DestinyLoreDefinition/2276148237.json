He goes to hear the song of death.\n[g:02] Nothing will deter him. None of you can stop him. Not anymore.\n[g:03] Toland will hear the Deathsinger's melody. He will redefine death, escape the Traveler's blunt samsara.\n[g:04] He will sound the depths of the powers you so myopically fear.\n[g:05] My only regret is that I will not live to see his triumph.\n\n\nTYPE: LIVE SURVEILLANCE FEED [CONTINGENCY-LINKED]\nPARTIES: Two [2].

They've broken the perimeter. Shall I engage defenses?\n[t:01] No need. They have inquisitive intentions. If murder was their mission, we'd have lost our Light long ago.\n[g:02] They want to know what you know.\n[t:02] Yes. And I will tell them, but they will never understand. I'll greet them with a smile and welcome them in.\n[t:03] I will learn how we can benefit from their ignorance.\n[g:03] Yes, but don't smile.\n[t:04] Why not? A smile hides the true purpose of teeth.\n[g:04] Yes, but not yours.",
