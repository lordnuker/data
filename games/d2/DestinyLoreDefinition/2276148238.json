But why?\n[silence]\n[oa:03] Dying up there won't bring her back, you know.\n[silence]\n[oa:04] Sorry. That wasn't… I'm sorry. Sometimes I say—\n[e3:01] You're honest, Omar. It's a quality I very much admire. So, allow me to be honest in return.\n[e3:02] We're going back, because we have found a way to destroy Crota. The Vanguard is too cowardly to use it.\n[oa:05] Cowardly?\n[e3:03] You know it's true. We hide behind the Wall as if it would save us, but what if Crota decided to descend?\n[e3:04] What if Crota and his armies landed in the City? How many more would die?\n[oa:06] But if Crota were to attack us, couldn't we defeat him here?\n[e3:05] No. The only means of destroying him is up there.\n[oa:07] Then why won't the Vanguard agree to—\n[e3:06] Eris and I went to Toland—\n[oa:08] Eris? Eris Morn?\n[e3:07] She sent me.\n[oa:09] Why the hell didn't you just say so? Let's go.",
