Not sure I even have the Light left to send it.\n[u:02] Thought I'd look for a Guardian on Luna. A First Light colonist. A downed Reef pilot. Maybe an Exo who never came home from the war.\n[u:03] Is it possible… to miss someone… you've never met?\n\n\nTYPE: CANDIDATE SCAN [CONTINGENCY-LINKED]\nPARTIES: One [1]. One [1] Ghost-type, designate undesignated [u]\nASSOCIATIONS: First Light\n//AUDIO UNAVAILABLE//\n//TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS…/\n\n[u:01] Finally! Another First Light technician.\n[u:02] All right, let's see about you…\n[u:03] Hoo boy. Another one.\n[u:04] DNA degradation alone makes this impossible, but even if I could bring you back, who'd put you back together again?\n[u:05] Inextirpable psychological trauma. Indelible psychosis: violence, paranoia, obsessive behavior. And… yup, some kind of hallucinatory mechanism. Damage to the occipital lobe and limbic, and then those weird formations in the parietal and temporal. It's like something rewired your brain but did it through your DNA.\n[u:06] What were they doing up here?",
