This sounds like a terrible piece of equipment.\"\n\n\"Close your mouth and listen. It does that until you strike something—\"\n\n\"Good, good good good. This is better. Then what?\"\n\n\"…\"\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n\"Then it whips the Light particles into each other at high speeds, causing a delayed—\"\n\n\"DELAYED?!\"\n\n\"A DELAYED FISSION REACTION.\"\n\n\"Why is it delayed?\"\n\n\"Let's move on.\"\n\n\"Okay… could you just sum it up for me?\"\n\n\"Punch something and an explosion will happen where you struck.\"\n\n\"Wonderful.
