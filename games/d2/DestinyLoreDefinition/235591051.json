In these disconcerting times, uncertainty and speculation have run rampant and grown wild. Burn it down. Raze it to ash.\n\n\"Remind them what Warlocks stand for. We are the inextinguishable Dawn shining through the midnight Darkness. They look to us as a lodestar. Show them the way forward.\n\n\"Be the symbol, Guardian. Embolden your friends and allies.\n\n\"Together, nothing can stop us.\"\n\n—Ikora Rey",
