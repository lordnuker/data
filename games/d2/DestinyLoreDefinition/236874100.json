Use each as you will.\n\nThese are not your strength, but may they bolster your might when the weight of expectation falls down upon thee.\n\nWhen the wars rage around you, find your peace.\nThe Light is not of you, and you are not of the Light, and yet you are one.\nGive of yourself, and you will find all that you fear is missing.\nYou are a hammer. You are a shield. Know the difference. Know yourself.\nTrust is a weapon. Handle with care.\nThe burden is not yours alone, no matter the burden.\nShould Darkness call, answer true, and it will shrink from the Light.\nWear your confidence with pride, but know it is a tool, not a weapon.\nBe mindful of the joy found in victory—it is earned but should never be the aim.\nFor all you will see, all you discover—never lose the gift of curiosity.\nThe Darkness would bend you to its will, but the Light bends to yours.\nFailure is an opportunity to learn.\nIf the bones talk, do not listen.\nI am your guide and your friend, your ally and your tool. Use me.\nI will never leave you, but should I fall, remain vigilant, remain true.\n\nThis isn't the whole of my life advice, but it's something. We'll add more as we go along.\n\n—An unknown Ghost's life advice for an unknown Guardian",
