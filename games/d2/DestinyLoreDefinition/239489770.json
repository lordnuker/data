His people—they envy you a great deal. When I think of him, and the hate he had for your homeworld and the benefits the Traveler bestowed upon it, I am reminded of the passion you have for its defense.\n\nBe like Sekris. Don't share his weakness, his questioning of my authority and right of way. But consider taking up his mantle.\n\nGive the Fallen something else to be jealous of.\n\nSeek me out and grow fat from strength.\n\n—Calus, Emperor of the Cabal",
