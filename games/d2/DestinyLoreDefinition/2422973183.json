Your body and mind were clear and light.\n\nWhen you felt passion, it coursed within you. Senses sharp. Everything crisp.\n\nAnd when you felt anger, it felt as if the blood would overtake you. Wrest control from thought, from reason.\n\nBut that was early on.\n\nYou have learned control, in all those things. You could call on it. Your mind is strong.\n\nBut now a new power courses through your veins. Through flesh. Through bone. It suffuses all that you are.\n\nSo now, the blood calls to YOU.\n\nAre you strong enough?",
