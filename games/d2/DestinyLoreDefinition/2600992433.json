But one must not only sharpen their blade. \n\nBehold Nokris. \n\nA mind can also be a weapon. There is power in wisdom, in knowledge. \n\nThere is much to be known. And he would know all. \n\nThe ageless volumes and apocrypha, all consumed voraciously, feeding the mind of the lesser. Driven by a different kind of Sword Logic, he let the stories of the world fill the void just as the worm feeds. \n\nFrom the womb of unholy knowledge, Nokris's plan was born. He knew his strength lies in his mind, in his magic. But how to prove himself to his father, the proud, dreadful demon-warrior? \n\nNokris is not the first. \n\nHe sought power. He sought knowledge. He sought the worm.",
