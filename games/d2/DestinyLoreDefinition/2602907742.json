No longer.\n\nWe are still there. We are not interested in Light or Dark.\n\nOur interest is in you. And those like you.\n\nWe have reached out before. With an agent whose will was not his own.\n\nFirst contact. We have learned since then.\n\nYour hands are bound in red ribbons.\n\nYour soul is weary.\n\nYour feet find purchase on a three-dimensional plane.\n\nYour bond's glow is dim; there is no Light here. Or Dark.",
