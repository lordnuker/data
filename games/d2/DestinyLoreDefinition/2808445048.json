Her heart clenched, racing; she turned inward.\n\nPatience. Breathing. Focus.\n\nShe felt the sky inside her, coalescing, shimmering. She thought of rain. She thought of the cheek of her unexpected friend, cupped in her hand, cold and wet. \"Just hang on— Please—\" she whispered. Something resembling a laugh susurrated from behind his many needle-like teeth. Water dripped from his chainmail mask into his open mouth. Her throat tasted like metal.\n\nPatience. Breathing. Focus.\n\nThe pregnant silence when animals go underground. The dance of water on the roof. The gentle sway of curtains on a humid evening. The distant beat of thunder.\n\nThe Wizards, howling now.\n\nPatience. Breathing. Focus.\n\nThe dark clouds grew heavier, and each of her bones thrummed with longing. She braided her hands in preparation, gathered herself inward, upward. She turned to run for the Wizards, who danced screaming over the corpse of her friend. The static came with her, wreaths of electricity, brightening at each step. When she began her war cry, the sky spoke for her, cracking, and she threw her palms in front of her—\n\nThe storm poured forth.\n\nPatience.\n\nBreathing.\n\nFocus.",
