You think yourself very high up on the pyramid of contumely.\n\nIf you only knew how high that pyramid goes.\n\nHigher than I knew when my radiant killer unsung me from biological squalor, or when I witnessed a royal secret turn death into a chrysalis. Higher than I described in my journals, or told to our mutual three-eyed friend.\n\nHigher than even I, sailor upon the Sea of Screams that I am, can yet see.\n\nPerhaps I will tell you about them.\n\nYou are right to ask why I would do so. Very good, dear squanderer, your intentions have grown sharp as thrallteeth.\n\nYou see, they know. What you are, what you were, what you will become. They know.\n\nWhat lean tithes you are to them. Soft whetstones make for dull blades.\n\nThis I define as the truth and tension of the rope: to bind, one must apply force at both ends.\n\nI think perhaps I will tell you after all.",
