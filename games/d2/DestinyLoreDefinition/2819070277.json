Have you had contact with an Ahamkara?” \nAriadne Gris: “No!” \nNew Monarchy: “Then why does your Sparrow bear a dragon logo?” \nAG: “Because dragons are cool.” \nNM: “If Ms. Gris won't take this seriously—” \nCayde-6: “Play nice, Ari. Hideo's knickers are real tight today.”  \nAG: “I thought a dragon'd look cool on my Sparrow. Not all dragons are Ahamkaras!” \nZ: “Ikora?

Are we really still talking about this?” \nDead Orbit: *muffled laughter* \nIR: “Obviously Gris has not had contact with an Ahamkara.” \nFWC: “How do you know?” \nIR: “If she had, she'd win SRL more often.” \nC6: *whistle* \nAG: “Harsh, Rey.” \nZ: “Then let the record show: the Consensus's official stance on the Dinas Emrys dragon symbol is: cool.”",
