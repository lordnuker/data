From that seat, there was no barrier between me and the glorious, adoring mob. I was their father; they were my children. \n\nIt was there that I brought the corrupt to suffer the people's justice. How they cried as I threw their riches to the crowd. It amused me to see the dawning of realization in their eyesâ€”there would be no safety for them, as there had been no safety for those they had made to suffer. \n\nOne by one, I tossed those weeping fools to the people. The mob let out a great cry of joy and stripped them of their robes, tore the jewelry from their bodies.",
