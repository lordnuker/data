Now I crave your permission and your blessing to point myself toward one in whose death I would take great delight.\"\n\nThe generous Emperor, pleased to no end with his bright Shadow of Shadows, said: \"Say no more. It is granted.\"\n\nGiving great and proper thanks, the Shadow of Earth went away and found the Guardian whose name was once Uldren Sov. The Shadow of Earth slew him, but spared his hateful little companion-soul so that the well of pleasure that was Uldren's death should never run dry.\n\nSo many times did the Shadow of Earth slay the one called Uldren Sov that no chronicler could ever record the exact number. At last, when the Shadow's appetite was whetted, Uldren Sov met his final death.",
