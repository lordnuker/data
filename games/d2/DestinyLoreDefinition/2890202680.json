The whole point of vacationing at the bottom of the ocean is to avoid calls.\n\nGeneral Fiedler: It's Fiedler, Hardy.\n\nH: Oh! Yes, sir.\n\nF: It's about Moon X.\n\nH: Sir?\n\nF: Your friend Evie was right. It's almost impossible to track, but she has a way, and now it showed up right where she said it would: inbound to Mars. Did you copy? It's going to be on Mars. You saw what it did to Jupiter and Mercury and Venus. So, we want to send a multinational crew to intercept it.\n\nH: Multinational…\n\nF: You'll be the pilot of the craft.\n\nH: Uh… look, I don't disagree with the idea, but Mars is 50 million km away. \n\nF: Give or take, yeah. The mission will have to depart for Mars in two months. Sixty days.\n\nH: Sixty days.\n\nF: So enjoy your vacation and then get back here. We're building a clubhouse and a ship. We're gonna catch this sucker.",
