MEDIUMS TO CHANNEL YOUR light. USELESS HERE, WHERE light AND dark HAVE NO PLACE.\n\nYou've built so many monuments, large and small, in worship of your Light.\n\nWill you do the same for the Dark?\n\nWill you ever build for yourselves again?\n\nYOUR QUESTION BEGS QUESTIONS FROM US.\n\nThe heavens above you are clear of stars and shadows.\n\nYour hands are bound in red ribbons.\n\nYour soul is weary.\n\nYour feet find purchase on a three-dimensional plane.",
