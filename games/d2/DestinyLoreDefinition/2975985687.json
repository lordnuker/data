        "description": "The congregation has departed.\n\nZulmak, impaled by a lesser blade, has failed.\n\nThe congregation is foolhardy.\n\nZulmak spins.\n\nLodged in his flesh, the blade snaps, its wielder now weaponless but for an edgeless grip.\n\nZulmak crushes the assailant with a single, mighty blow, but the damage is done.\n\nThe horde piles on, weighing him down. Cutting. Slicing.\n\nThe would-be champion is swallowed by the mass.\n\nAcross the Pit, the attention of the combatants shifts. They turn on each other. There is no more champion, so a new champion must claim victory. The sword logic demands it.\n\nBeneath the mound of writhing bone and claw, those who rushed Zulmak poke and prod, killing all beneath their weight.\n\nThen movement. And a terrible scream.\n\nThe heap quakes and pulses.\n\nThen, a powerful thrust. Bodies fly, and an angry shape stomps forth.\n\nZulmak, impaled a dozen times, perhaps more—decorated in blade and hilt—roars.\n\nAll eyes fall upon him.\n\nHe slumps, breathes heavily, then stands.\n\nThe heap continues to writhe.\n\nZulmak climbs its uneven slope, crushing the weak underfoot.\n\nReaching the bony peak of bodies living and dead, the wounded champion issues a challenge—a gut-born, ragged battle cry.\n\nZulmak, the Impaled.\nZulmak, the Unfelled.\nZulmak, the Destroyer.\n\nThe horde charges.\n\nClambering to reach him, high above the pile.\n\nAnd when they do, they offer themselves, one after another, to his devastating embrace—sacrificing themselves to the champion, to the logic.\n\nThey are not worthy.\n\nBut maybe—maybe—Zulmak is.",
