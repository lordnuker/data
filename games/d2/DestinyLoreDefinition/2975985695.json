All evolution is forced, and the sword logic will not rest idle as spoiled children claw for purchase at the vacant thrones of vanquished Kings and Princes.\n\"I see them as they are.\n\"Liars.\n\"Pretenders.\n\"As their King.\n\"As his Prince.\n\"The whole of the Court's lineage is unworthy. History would say otherwise. But history is not truth.\n\"That I alone see the flaw in our future is a crime for which all others shall be punished.\"",
