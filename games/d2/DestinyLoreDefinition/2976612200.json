Before her passing, she had long sought a seat on my Psion Council, to help maintain the nightmare realm I reserve for prisoners and punishing wayward Loyalists. But she proved to be too valuable an asset in the field.\n\nThe life of a Shadow is sometimes a life of disappointment, and it pains me to say so. A burden I will carry until the end comes.\n\n—Calus, Emperor of the Cabal",
