But it is not fear that provokes me.\n\nUncontrollable rage fills me as the Nightmare of Crota returns to taunt me for my failures once again. I am always failing.\n\nThe countless lives taken during the Great Disaster, my fireteam, and my own lost humanity—they have all come rushing back. I am trying in vain to stop a waterfall with a tree branch. I am overwhelmed. I fail again.\n\nThe Eater of Hope laid waste to world after world in his pursuit of the Traveler. My friends… His sword stole their Light. Their. Light.\n\nThere was never a path to forgiveness with Crota. He had to be… eradicated.\n\nThe peace I felt learning of his demise at the hands of Guardians was immeasurable. I took pleasure in his death. I relished in it.\n\nThe Darkness will win. I can sense it already.\n\nI swore I would go on. I can no longer swear this. Always failing.\n\nRelieve me.",
