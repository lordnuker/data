		"description": "The Dawning is a time of great generosity and gift-giving. It feels very good to receive a gift, especially a thoughtful one that was chosen for you by someone you care for. If you approach gift-giving with love and a selfless heart, it deepens your relationship to another person. As I'm sure you know by now, it is as rewarding to give a gift as to receive it.\n\nWhen you find yourself receiving many gifts, maybe unexpectedly, look to the giver. Have you given them anything? Gift-giving is not score-keeping, but when you are showered with luxurious gifts made of gold, engraved with your name, lavished upon you with great bouts of flatteryâ€”stop and think about why you have received them.\n\nSometimes you should question these gifts. Consider who the gift-giver has favored before. Why you? Why now? If you have no satisfying or reassuring answer to these questions, the chances are good that this gift-giver is carefully tallying your \"debts,\" and will one day move to collect them.\n\nNot all gifts are given freely. Remember that.\n\nThat's all, my dear friend. I have no story this time. Just a warning.",
