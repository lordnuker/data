Ikora Rey, the Consensus formally requests you assume the responsibilities of Warlock Vanguard.\"\nIkora Rey: \"Considering I've been performing those responsibilities for a while now, I accept.\"\nFWC: \"Why did you cover for him for so long?\"\nIR: \"Someone had to do it.\"\nS: \"Ahem. Now that we have Consensus, I may inform you I have decided to banish former Warlock Vanguard Osiris from the Last City.\"\n[murmurs]\nS: \"Are there any objections?\"\nDO: \"None here. Maybe he'll find a better planet for us.\"\n[pause]\nS: \"Very well. Next: I name Titan Vanguard Zavala as the new Vanguard Commander. Congratulations.\"",
