Impressive!\" —Lord Shaxx\n\n\"Despite a lack of rigorous data analysis and an overreliance on the mystical, this book has merits that even I must acknowledge.\" —Asher Mir\n\n\"Based on the couple of pages I got through, this is one of Ikora's most well-rounded works yet, although she makes kind of a circular argument. Also, the paper's really high quality. Very soft and smooth.\" —Cayde-6",
