I know because I was born inside its commwire-satellite-datawave skeleton.\n\nBut even before that, before the Traveler wove us into a tapestry of peculiar threads, this was a planet of big, big worlds.\n\nMany of those worlds were lost in a collapse, but not the one you're thinking of. Before the great Collapse, there was another. A longer, slower, bitterer collapse.\n\nSome things survive. Names upon rusted signs, phrases in impervious microfiche. As other Guardians save humans, I save words. I save stories.\n\nThat is my mission, here on the shores of the Hawkesbury Sea. I surface the survivors. The sweet-voiced koodelong. The swift gangurru. The sharp-fanged tarrabah.\n\nIt's a mission the Traveler started. After all, she surfaced me.",
