The wind roars around you.\n\nThe shifting sand is all you see.\n\nAs you continue to stare, it occurs to you that the Tower might look similar if you stood still for long enough. And your boots, sheathed as they are in a thin veneer of Light, would stay pristine.\n\nYou smell a rotting stench.\n\nA harsh glare blooms from the heavens above.\n\nSomething grips your hands, desperately shaking them.\n\nYour soul is weary.\n\nYour cloak billows in the wind, yet something clings to it, weighing it down.",
