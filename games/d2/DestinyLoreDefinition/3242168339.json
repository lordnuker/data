I'm sorry I didn't believe you.\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter now,\" Petra says. He can make out the spires of the Keep of Voices behind her, but not the nuance of her expression.

You're young; you were still green. You certainly weren't Sjur. When Mara died, and suddenly you were Regent instead of me or Devi or whoever…\"\n\nIt's hard to confess such ugly things.\n\nHe shakes his head, pushing his computer away at arm's-length. \"When everything is going wrong, but you aren't in charge, it's easy to imagine you could do a better job. But I was wrong. I didn't understand that the job was to keep the faith. None of us could have done that except you.\"",
