He waits for Saladin to justify the strategy.\n\n[I repeat: All teams rally at the Ridgeback District. Do NOT advance. The City is lost.]\n\nShaxx drops the Vandal, then empties the rest of his clip into a Captain. He and his fireteam are running on fumes. The dead, Fallen and Guardian alike, litter the Twilight Gap. \n\n[Shaxx! Do you copy?]\n\nHe risks a look over his shoulder at their home, the place they call the Last Safe City. Not burning. Not yet. Gritting his teeth, he reloads.\n\n[Shaxx, your orders are to retreat.]\n\nHe sees a gap in the onslaught of invaders and gestures to the others. \"Nkechi! Take Abdi and Truce. Liu Feng, with me! Bray! Cover us!\"\n\n[This battlefield is not your stage, Shaxx! This is not about glory!]\n\nHis fireteam doesn't hesitate.\n\n[Shaxx! For the final time: Fall! Back!]\n\nAs the six of them crest the Wall, Shaxx cuts the feed.",
