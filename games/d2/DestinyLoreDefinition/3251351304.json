We take care with those. It is how we [feed].\n\nBut she won.\n\nI remember when I carved this cage into the face of reality. I remember when she [wished] me into it.\n\n[The Queen] is vulnerable. I can see her far away, facing into a storm.\n\nThe light around my cage fades. [Darkness] fills the chamber as a sheer force of will passes over it.\n\nBefore me stands a [King]. He offers to take me away. But I know he will not let me leave, either. An unfavorable position.\n\nI never made a [bargain] with a [King]. I would like to try it. I tell him to take whatever he [wishes]. As long as he [wishes].\n\nHe agrees. I make an ugly sound with my mandibles. I cannot help myself. I find this scenario mirthful.\n\nThen so does he. We do it together. Loud gusts of sound from our faces for whole moments.\n\nMost of those who [bargain] with me do not win.",
