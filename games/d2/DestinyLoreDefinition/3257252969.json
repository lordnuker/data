Recommend classification of said Lightbearer as \"Warlord.\"\n\nMy host engaged, but the target occupied advantageous terrain and our Ghosts' resurrection times have increased by another 2.8 percent, a 0.6 increase from my last report. Further analysis is attached to this report.\n\nAfter several waves, a retreat seemed the only tactical option left to us. Before I could issue the command, a new variable entered the field from above.\n\nAt first I believed it to be a Warsat. My initial assessment proved incorrect; the variable was a Titan who deployed himself from high ground to deliver an aerial melee assault upon the target.\n\nThis proved a turning point in the battle, and we were soon able to incapacitate the Warlord and prepare him for return to the Tower. I have asked the Titan to file his own report, which is also attached.\n\nEND MESSAGE\n\n\nBEGIN ATTACHMENT\n\nFrom: Vell Tarlowe\nTo: Saint-14\nCategory: 8-sat bounce\nPriority: 1\n\nI just had the best. Day. Of. My. Life. Get ready for thisâ€¦",
