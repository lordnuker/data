But it's stable enough to ride. I've tried it.\"\n\n\"Does the fire ever go out?\"\n\n\"Not as far as I can tell.\"\n\n\"Huh.\" Ariadne crossed her arms. \"Seems dangerous.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Like I said, it's stable for now, and I can ride it, but who knows how long that'll last. It could probably explode at any second.\"\n\nThey stood in silence, watching the charred Sparrow burn.\n\n\"Cool,\" Ariadne whispered.\n\nMarcus grinned. \"I know, right?\"",
