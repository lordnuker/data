        "description": "From the journals of Ikora Rey\n\nWhen I studied with Osiris, he would often tell me: \"I see failure in your future.\" No matter how hard I worked, no matter how strong I became, always: \"I still see failure.\"\n\nI think now what he saw was Io.\n\nWhen I lost my Light and retreated from a ruined City, when I arrived on Io to find only silence, I too thought I had failed. Even after Ghaul's defeat and the Traveler's waking, I told my friends I thought the Traveler had tested me, and that I had failed its test.\n\nBut now I'm not so sure.\n\nPerhaps what Osiris saw for me—what I experienced on Io—was simply that I needed help. That most Human of conditions. I needed to be in a fireteam, and to be a fireteam for others in turn.\n\nHow like Osiris to see that and name it failure.\n\nI won't make that mistake again.",
