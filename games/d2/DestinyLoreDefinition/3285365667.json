And even then the City didn't truly lose them, for when the Speaker ordered me to destroy Osiris's writings, I placed the documents in my private library instead. I don't believe in burning books, regardless of my opinion of the author.\n\nAs to why he had to write the prophecies in iambic couplets? Simple: vanity.",
