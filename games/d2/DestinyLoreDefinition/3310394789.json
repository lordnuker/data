Last rites.\n\n\"So, walk careful—head on a swivel, hand on the hilt, all that—cuz that glare you feel is the narrowed eyes of ill-intent aimed at your honor, your heart… your head.\n\n\"And know this: Your every step is set upon blooded ground. The whole of the Shore… This is a wasteland built where a few sought to survive. In the dim light of a lost age, this wild frontier was a fleeting hope-turned-final restin' place—a graveyard at the end of existence.\n\n\"Some say you can still hear the screams—echoes of the lost and damned ringing from just out of sight. Don't believe 'em. That's just the stretching and bending of the supports—old metal moaning in the celestial breeze, the grinding of scrap and stone calling out, giving warning.\n\n\"These tethered lands be not safe. This twisted reef be not kind.\"\n\n—Excerpt from C.C. LaGrange's Translations of \"Writings and Observations from the Tangled Shore: A Fallen Text\"\n\n\n\"There's no way that's a direct translation.\"\n—Cayde-6",
