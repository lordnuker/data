		"description": "\"Out here, the lonely fall in the company of those bound by the purest need: survival.\n\n\"Find this truth. If not in your heart, in your mind. If not your mind, then your soul—the deepest part of you that connects to the most basic truths. To live for tomorrow, you have to fight for today.\n\n\"Know this. Understand it. Live it. Find those likeminded survivors you can look to as kin. Only then can survival be within reach, because to walk the Shore unbound is to invite death.\"\n\n—Excerpt from C.C. LaGrange's Translations of \"Writings and Observations from the Tangled Shore: A Fallen Text\"",
