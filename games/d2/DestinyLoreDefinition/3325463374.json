Music flowed in their souls and rained from their lips.\nNot weapons of war they made, but instruments of peace.\n\nThe thunder fell, and they were cast apart. Their love was sundered as the world collapsed.\nThey sang in pain and sought to reunite, but crimson eyes glowed in the dark. Their union was not to be.\n\nHe held death in his hands. Stars burned in his footsteps.\nIn her, the conflagration was reborn, the funeral pyre lit.\n\nAnd so forever after, their love fuels death. Their last words, a curse and a cry.\nTheir names are now lost, but their love will not die.",
