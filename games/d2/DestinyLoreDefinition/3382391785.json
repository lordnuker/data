That's the thing I do better than anyone. Not care. Let them come in their hundreds and every one will die at my feet. I don't care about their homing rockets, their exotic matter slugs, their blades from another dimension. \n\nI don't care because I cannot be moved. I am the wall against which the Darkness breaks. \n\nMalphur can turn his gun to fire and Shinobu can dance with lightning, but when the horrors run out of the dark, I am the one who does not move.  \n\nI am a wall. And walls don't move. Because walls don't care.",
