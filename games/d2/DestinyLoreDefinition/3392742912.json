Your feet are light. \nYou strike like silent lightning. \nYour light shines like a glistening edge in the sun. \n\nYou are the snake. \nYou are level and silent. You move with purpose. \nYour enemies feel fear in your presence. \nYour fangs are sharp and quick. \nYour eyes are clear and your wrath is blinding. \n\nYou are the blade. You are the snake. \n\nStrike. Shimmer. Survive.",
