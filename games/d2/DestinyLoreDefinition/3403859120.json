These are the things, both constraint and power, which define the universe of possible actions. These are the rule makers and instruments which enforce reality.\n\nGive a power to a Guardian and they shall know that power as a weapon, for when a Guardian chooses to alter the world, they do so with the bullet and the blade. Grant a Guardian godly power, and that Guardian shall fashion it into a perfect rifle. The demiurge of the Guardian is the gun.\n\nBut we must remember that the demiurge is not the god. It is only the thing that converts perfect divine will into imperfect material form. We may wield the demiurge; but if we do, what god wields us?\" â€”Ulan-Tan",
