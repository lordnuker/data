You're on my side.\n\nI see it when your body becomes a weapon with which you obliterate your opponents, when your knuckles become a part of your foe's countenance, when you smash them with your Light. And it is captivating. But Earth casts no Shadow. Not yet.\n\nWhen you're ready, you will be magnificent. A Guardian of Guardians. Shadow of Shadows.\n\nI reserve the right to be last when the end comes, and for that, I will need you with me.\n\nYou're so close.\n\n—Calus, Emperor of the Cabal",
