Rifles, sidearms, and… hand cannons. Drifter pulled a cannon out of the long box, held it up in the dim light.\n\nNo one made Dark Age guns anymore. Drifter had looked far and wide. The one source of Dark Age weaponry in this system was him. Gambit.\n\nDark Age weapons had been forged at a time when Light fought Light. Everything was just a little more efficient back then. And lethal. In Drifter's opinion, of course.\n\nBut Tex Mechanica? They came close. They made very reliable cannons. Drifter stared hard at the one he held. The stuff of legend.\n\nThe train car jostled, snapping him out of his daydream.\n\nHe took everything he could carry.",
