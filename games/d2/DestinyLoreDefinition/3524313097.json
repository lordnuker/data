Rebirth.\n\nSai: Once something is gone, it should stay that way.\n\nEriana-3: I can't share that sentiment.\n\nSai: You will never find peace if you can't accept your loss.\n\nEriana-3: I'll find peace when I rip that monster's beating heart from his chest.\n\nEris: I have never known vengeance to bring peace.\n\nEriana-3: What do you think I should hope for, then? All I have left is my vengeance and my gun.\n\nEris: A Hand Cannon with a sight, yet you see nothing but rage. Don't allow it to cloud your judgement. Wei gave you the weapon for a purpose.\n\nEriana-3: Yeah, to keep me at a distance from the Hive. And now I'm heading straight toward them. Somewhere out there, she's shaking a fist at me.\n\nEris: We can honor her still by ridding the world of the disease that is Crota.\n\nEriana-3: There is no world for me after Crota.\n\nEris: What you are feeling… is to be expected. In time, we can forge a new world. Together.\n\nEriana-3: I want to believe that is possible.\n\nVell: I hate to interrupt this touching moment, but does anyone else hear that?\n\nSai: That rumble?\n\nToland: Thralls… I think they mean to welcome us.\n\nEriana-3: Let them come. I'll be the last Light they ever see.",
