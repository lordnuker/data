Back in the Dark Ages. You came up back then, right?\"\n\nShe chews on her lip and the sensation causes her mind to buzz with the same number, over and over: nine-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine-nine… \"Yeah,\" she says, centering herself. \"I did. I, uh…\" She looks at Gol for validation. His wings are tucked tight against his shell, small and wary. \"Gol rezzed me somewhere east of New Whulge. Made my way south from there.\"\n\n\"Is that so? Huh.\" He pretends to think about it. \"You ever run with the Pilgrim Guard?\"\n\nThat sparks a memory. Orin narrows her eyes. \"I did.\"\n\n\"Yeah? Me too. Used to be close with one of 'em. Lady had a tattoo of a snake. Right here.\" Wu Ming taps his arm. His hand shakes. \"You ever seen a tattoo like that?\"\n\nOrin clasps her hand protectively over her upper arm, covering her tattoo.\n\nAll at once, the buzzing stops.",
