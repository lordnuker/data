Shots tore through brush and kicked up stone on the other side of the boulder, but he was already moving up the slope, using the grenade's explosion to cover his movement.\n\nA quick peek from his new vantage point revealed no sign of them downslope. A day ago, they would have taken the bait. Yardarm-4 would have run up and made a shield to cover Rekkana. Then she would have jumped over it to land behind the boulder, a comet of energy that would meteor down to finish him off.\n\nHe'd taught them to be more patient.\n\n\"What did you want?\" Yardarm-4 called from about three o'clock, moving to Lisbon-13's right—but it could have been a feint. \"You accepted.

It could only take it away.\"\n\nLisbon-13 lifted his gleaming eyes to meet Rekkana's cobalt gaze and raised Divinity.",
