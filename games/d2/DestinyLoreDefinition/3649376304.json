		"description": "Osiris sits in the small stone garden beneath the Traveler; his attempts at communion unsuccessful. He had seen the Speaker stand here for hours. \n\nIkora had begrudgingly agreed to appear in his place at the Remembrance. Her words were stern, but deep down, she knows victories have lulled in complacency.\n\nThere is an imminent, daunting pressure.\n\nA noose awaiting a misstep.\n\nA delicate game.\n\nBraziers cast shadows; distracting shades flickering across his eyes, breaking his concentration.\n\nOsiris breathes.\n\nThe stone gardens are endless space. The skyline is razed horizon.\n\nBreathe.\n\nHe is alone in the void. Intrusions no more.\n\nThere is a point in the depth. It cannot be directly viewed.\n\nDelve. Dive. Deeper.\n\nStill, only a point in the aphotic depth.\n\nThe nothing. Expansive.\n\nOsiris sinks to gain new perspective. The point remains.\n\nIt is so faint. Distant. Though he knows he can see the Light.\n\nHis reach stretched thin. Clarity, in the space between his hand and the point. The osseous-white point. Dim now.\n\nThe omnipresence was.\n\nHungry acknowledgement.\n\nVast. Himself against the enormity; an endless unfurling midnight. And a lone point.",
