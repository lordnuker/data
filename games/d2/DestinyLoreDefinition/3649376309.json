Make us a sub-net.\n\nOsiris-3-7-294:\nI will miss my next rendezvous.\n\nSaint-3-8-294:\nIs that so? I suspected this would happen when your trip suddenly became longer. I will tell the Vanguard that your ship was damaged and has caused delay. Do not make me lie for you again. I do not like lying. It upsets Geppetto.\nAdditionally, tell Sagira that I remember her promise and that I am owed a debt if she does not keep it.\n\nOsiris-4-0-294:\nSagira does not gamble.\n\nSaint-4-1-294:\nIt is not gambling. It is different from gambling. She cannot be nagging you enough. Your response time on our letters is terrible.\nPlease try my suggestion. I believe it will help.\n\nOsiris-5-14-294:\nIs Ikora well? Are you?\n\nSaint-5-14-294:\nWe are both disappointed, but we will live.\nFather cannot defend you any longer. \n\nOsiris-5-14-294:\nI will speak for myself.\n\nSaint-5-17-294:\nThat was quite the show.\nWhere are you?\n\nOsiris-6-2-294:\nFinding answers.\nWe will speak soon.\n\nOsiris-9-29-296:\nWhere are you?",
