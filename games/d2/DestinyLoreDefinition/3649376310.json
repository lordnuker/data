        "description": "Stone-laid roads lead Saint-14 through the City. He walks them most days when he is home. When time permits.\n\nThe people wave. They cheer.\n\nThey bring offerings of their support and adoration.\n\nBreads. Tokens. Wonderfully spun tassels and bands of royal purple hue.\n\nHis name had become synonymous with the Guardians.\n\nAn image to be adhered to; to be revered.\n\nHe smiles and shakes their hands.\n\nHe smiles and accepts their gifts.\n\nTheir joy is his.\n\nHe feels the weight of their royal ribbons around his neck, drawn tight by expectation.\n\nHis armor is faith. It slips and loosens in transit.\n\nThey sing together. He shares bread with the chorus of voices. He ties ribbons in their hair.\n\nHis joy is theirs.\n\nThey sing him a new song.\n\nTheir voices shine bright.",
