I like it.\" The Spider examines a dense data display on the specs of the proposed race. His HUD scrolls a rapid series of calculations. \"And with a Sparrow like that as the prize, there's going to be plenty of interest. Where did you get it, anyway?\" \n\nThe Fallen gang leader shrugs his top pair of shoulders. \"Guardians like to gamble. Badly.\" \n\n\"That they do,\" the Spider says and collapses the data display, focusing his attention on his visitor. \"Of course, there will be expenses: security, clean up, bribes.

And finally, I need to know who's going to win the race before it starts.\" \n\nThe Fallen thug nods. \"Three percent. Keep the scrap. Winner will be me. Always me.\" His entourage cackles in agreement. \n\nThe Spider holds all four of his palms outward, signaling concurrence. \"Then it's a deal. Happy hunting.\"",
