The Vex hollowed out the planet, replaced its molten heart with cold right angles.\n\nBut that is not what I see.\n\nI see infinity.\n\nAn infinity of possible worlds, so perfectly simulated as to be indistinguishable from the experiences I once called \"reality.\" I can touch them, taste them, pass lifetimes in them! They grow within this machine like fruit upon a tree—no, a forest of trees, its fractal expansion nigh unmeasurable.\n\nI said that to Sagira and she replied, \"Sounds like a challenge.\"\n\nThis Ghost of mine knows me too well.\n\nIt strikes me now that I could find in this Infinite Forest a reality in which Ikora accompanied me into its endless mysteries.\n\nWhat an awful, destructive machine this is.\n\nI must know everything about it.",
