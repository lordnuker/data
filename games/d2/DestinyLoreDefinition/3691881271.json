His obsession with the ideal form has produced a hollow people devoid of culture, robbed of their history. \n\nThe Leviathan is now home to the last of us true Cabal. We will remember the old ways, for I am the wellspring from which our great civilization flows. \n\nAnd when my empire returns, the traitors will see us as through a dark mirror. We will be a terrifying reminder of their former selves. In that moment, they will feel the shame of their betrayal. They will know I have come for my revenge. \n\nThe Red Legion will not escape the sins of their past. They shall be consumed by them.",
