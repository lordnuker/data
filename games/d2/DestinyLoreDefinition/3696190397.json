Special Flight Services. I'm, like, never here, I don't know anybody.\n\nGF: And you are?\n\nE: Evie, sir, Evie Calumet.\n\nDC: Evie's one of our leading theoretical physicists. She has something important to show security services.\n\nH: OK.\n\nE: This. This shape you see.\n\nH: It was important to show me a moon?\n\nE: Not a moon. The weight's wrong and anyway, it shouldn't be there.\n\nH: Is that planet beside itâ€”\n\nE: Jupiter. Does everybody get that? This thing just appeared in our solar system, and it's anyone's guess why.\n\nGF: What are its capabilities?\n\nDC: So far we don't know. Maybe it's just a roving satellite. Maybe it's something a lot scarier.",
