One good shot, and everyone else would abandon this foolish crusade on this miserable planet—\n\n\"This is all of them? The most advanced weapons you have?\"\n\nZahn tried not to lose his temper. \"Would I have made the trip all the way to this 'throne room' without them?\"\n\nIt was a lie, of course, but this puffed-up \"Dominus\" didn't need to know about the experimental vehicles Zahn had been working on since—\n\n\"Were I you, Zahn, I would think hard before giving so flippant an answer.\"\n\nThis was the \"Consul\" who had deposed Zahn's best customer. Zahn didn't turn around as he said, \"If I were you, roach, I would think hard before wasting the time of the only real weapons supplier you've got.\"\n\nGrowls from all over the room, but Zahn smiled.
