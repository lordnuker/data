Every shell I leave in my wake is evidence of my meditations. \n\nI know the forces that move against us. I have studied endlessly. I have transcended our libraries.  \n\nI listen to the whispers of my Hidden and I grow wiser every day. \n\nI live what I teach, but I could not predict Ghaul. This is my failing, and I must answer for it.\n\n—Ikora Rey, Warlock Vanguard",
