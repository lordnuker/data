Your predecessors have sought to understand other sources of power, to control them. None have embraced them like I have. Like you could.\n\nThere is an entire spectrum of power left untapped that your Light prevents you from realizing.\n\nWhen the time comes, seek me out. I will teach you to grow fat from strength.\n\n—Calus, Emperor of the Cabal",
