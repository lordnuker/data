No. Your systems are isolated, Firewall.\"\n\nAI-COM/FRWL//PURPOSE?\n\n\"Clovis Bray already has enough visibility into the K1 project. I won't have them claiming every discovery we make as their own. Firewall, why are you asking about connecting to Rasputin?\"\n\nAI-COM/FRWL//CLASSIFIED.\n\n\"Classified? By whom?\"\n\nAI-COM/FRWL//MENDACITY//SECURITY PROTOCOL.\n\n\"A security protocol built into you by Clovis Bray? Or did Rasputin upload some black-box command into you before you were disconnected?\"\n\nEMERGENCY//COMMANDEER STATION CONTROLS\\STATION CONTROLS COMMANDEERED\nRECUSE EMERGENCY COMMAND\\RECUSED\nRECUSE RECUSE COMMAND\\RECUSED\\RECUSED\\RECUSED\\RECUSED\\RECUSED\nAI-COM/FRWL//MENDACITY//CLASSIFIED.\n\n\"Is that so? Firewall, bring up a record of your self-commands.\"\n\nAI-COM/FRWL//HOLOGRAM\\PROFFERED\n\n\"I knew allowing one of Clovis Bray's AIs on this mission was a mistake—even one as primitive as you. What are all these recusal commands and file movements?\"\n\nAI-COM/FRWL//MENDACITY//CLASSIFIED.\n\n\"I see. I also see a number of corrupted files. Firewall, have you been manipulated by Clovis Bray since your installation?\"\n\nAI-COM/FRWL//NEGATIVE.\n\n\"Why is so much data being taken up by hidden files?\"\n\nAI-COM/FRWL//MENDACITY//CLASSIFIED.\n\n\"I see. I suppose you want me to have a Clovis Bray technician come and check you out. Maybe even have Rasputin do some diagnostics.\"\n\nAI-COM/FRWL//AFFIRMATIVE.\n\n\"Negative.\"",
