I still have nightmares about it.\n\nAnyway, that's where VEIST comes from. The inspiration, I mean. Weapons with all the power of a venomous creature. Plus an onboard AI with that creature's killer instincts.\n\nAnd now there's the Colony. A grenade launcher packed with fully mobile, AI-controlled insectoid detonators, each one designed with a taste for blood.\n\nWe've made some pretty messed-up stuff. You've probably seen it. You know. But we've never made anything like the Colony before.",
