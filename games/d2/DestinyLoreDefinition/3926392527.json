Doubt it mentioned the omnipotent space anathema that's coming to kill you and your dog and your whole soccer club, either, but what's a little xenocide between friends?\n\nMaybe you don't care. A gun never stops and wonders if things are more complicated. It just shoots.\n\nIt's also possible that I'm just trying to get inside your head. You're a hero with a cape and a gun and a bike. You're gonna live forever. Who's got time for doubt? Fight the \"Darkness\"! Yeah!\n\nYou know what I'd call \"dark,\" in the sense of \"grim,\" in the sense of \"cosmically upsetting\"? A universe full of weaponized puppets, enacting a genocidal war against the servants of a rival god.\n\nIs this making you uncomfortable? I'm sorry. I'll be more evil. Boo. Grrr.",
