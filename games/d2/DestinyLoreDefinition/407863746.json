Perhaps a reunion is in order? \n\nMy agents have left ahead of me to prepare for my arrival.Â  I like to establish good relationships with the locals. I know it may surprise you, but one of the ways in which I have grown is my attitude towards the lesser species. I've come to believe that there is a place for all creatures in my empire.
