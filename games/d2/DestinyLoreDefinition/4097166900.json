They will enter the court and challenge its king and dance in its killing ground, and they will master the school of sword logic so mightily that they will overturn its teacher and forsake the crown.\n\nSoon.\n\nBut soon may not be soon enough, because Oryx roams the hallowed spires and melancholy shores of the Dreaming City. He stands looking out over the mists of her beautiful creation, and he laughs.\n\nShe can feel him there like a thorn in the meat of her palm.\nShe scolds herself for not factoring Shuro Chi's love into her design. Then she berates herself for this nervous energy, this fretful self-cannibalism.\n\nLungless, Mara remembers the sensation of a deep breath. Enacts it in her mind.\n\nShe remembers the singularity before her.\n\nShe waits.",
