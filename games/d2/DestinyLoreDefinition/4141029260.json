What in the world is going on?\n\nProvost: Have they already been in?\n\nM: Who's “they”? The computers are gone. The cabinets have been emptied out.\n\nP: Oh, well, this isn't how it was supposed to go. Dr. Mihaylova. Please, sit.\n\nM: I will not sit! What's happening? Have I been terminated? What are you people—\n\nP: For heaven's sake. No. Your equipment is safe. It's been moved. You've been chosen to design the AI for the Catamaran mission.\n\nM: I'm in the middle of my research here.\n\nP: Well, now you're going to continue it there. And look— you'll be a household name.\n\nM: I don't have any interest in that.\n\nP: Ah! But they're interested in you. Hang on.\n\nM: What?\n\nP: I just sent you your itinerary. You're on a flight, Dr. Mihaylova. This afternoon. You're going to meet your computers at Central Command in Florida. Look at it this way: you'll get some sun.",
