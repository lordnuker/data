You perceive shouting over the rush of air, but you can't make out the words. You lean closer to your hands, to whatever's clasping them, shaking them.\n\nThe shouting grows eager.\n\nYou can smell it now; whatever has seized you. Ancient. Rotting. Powerful.\n\nIts grip is strong—as strong as yours, the heat of the Light coursing through it.\n\nIt can smell the Light on you, too. It knows you are just like it.\n\nIt has lived forever. A gift from your shared parent. Forever is too long.\n\nYou think you know what it's saying now.\n\nIt begs for death.\n\nYour vision gradually returns…\n\nA harsh glare blooms from the heavens above.\n\nYour soul is weary.\n\nYour feet find purchase in shifting sands.\n\nYour cloak billows in the wind, yet something clings to it, weighing it down.",
