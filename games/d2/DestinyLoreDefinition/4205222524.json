I remember being across from Andal that night, with a fire between us, dead tired. \n\nWhen night rolled around on those trips, he'd get so quiet I used to think he'd fallen asleep. Thinking it all through, I guess. Lost in his own head.\n\nI remember getting sick of hearing nothing but the fire, so I broke the silence. Said I really liked his cloak and was thinking that, one of these days, I just might steal it.\n\nI remember the easy grin on his face when he said, \"You'll have to peel it off my dead body.\"\n\n\"Great,\" I said. \"Don't know if I've mentioned, but I got no problem looting a buddy's corpse. Waste not, want not, I always say. Besides, you'd want me to have it.\"\n\nWe laughed about that.\n\nIt's funny what you remember.",
