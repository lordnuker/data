But then I gotta go. There's a thing in Belarus; I should be back Monday.\n\nE: If you're in a hurry, can I have your brownie?\n\nH: You can have half. What did you want to show me?\n\nE: Moon X is back.\n\nH: Oh, boy. We saw what it did to Jupiter.\n\nE: Or \"with.\" You could think of it as \"with Jupiter.\"\n\nH: Whatever, the thing made some major changes to two of Jupiter's moons.\n\nE: Yep, then it blinks out. Gone fourteen months. Then Mercury. And then blink, out. Seven months.\n\nH: And you can't track it.\n\nE: Oh, I think I might have a way. But right now that doesn't matter because guess what just showed up hanging out next to Venus.\n\nH: You're kidding.\n\nE: I wish.\n\nH: Let me see that. What's it gonna do there?\n\nE: I don't know. Magic, I guess. You know what really worries me? Next time it blinks out?\n\nH: Where does it go?\n\nE: Where does it go.\n\nH: You can have the rest of my brownie.",
