When you embed those tiny, edged trinkets into their hearts. When you pierce them with your Light. And it is captivating.\n\nBut Earth casts no Shadow. Not yet.\n\nWhen you're ready, you will be magnificent. A Guardian of Guardians. Shadow of Shadows.\n\nI reserve the right to be last when the end comes, and for that, I need you with me.\n\nYou're so close.\n\n—Calus, Emperor of the Cabal",
