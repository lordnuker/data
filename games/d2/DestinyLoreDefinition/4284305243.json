Until now, we've only had three or four rules, barring any newly invented misdeeds of which we are yet to be made aware. Unfortunately, we are forced to increase our rules by two. \n\nFour (or five): Olu Alderdice is heretofore banned from our establishment. \nFive (or six, who's counting): Alderdice's inventions are also forbidden. Anyone found to be in possession of devices such as, but not limited to, spring-razor petticoats, electrified fascinators, sidearm tricksleeves, or arsenic lipstick will be introduced to our bouncer. Who is a Titan. A very big one. Named Karl. \n\nThank you for your understanding, and please enjoy your stay. Unless you're Olu Alderdice. Go away, Olu.",
