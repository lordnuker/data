        "description": "Sure, we've had you covered on the ground with our impressive arsenal of apex munitions for some time, but VEIST recognizes when it's time to step up the game.\n\nNow, we're elevating the fight to new horizons with our Chrysopelea-S, possessing all the attributes you've come to expect from the Last City's leading foundry. This noxious wonder makes the skies friendly again, with weapons-grade onboard AI, defensive lateral undulation flight patterns, and a cockpit cozier than a hug from a python.\n\nYour enemies (probably your friends too) will be seething with jealousy when you take off faster than a Viper's strike. Shed your old ride and slide into the Chrysopelea-S. It'll feel like a brand new skin.",
