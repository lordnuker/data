And don't go nattering on with that “Guardian” business either, not where she can hear you. There are no “Guardians” out here. To her, anyone that can pick up a gun and shoot is a “Guardian.” \n\nI know you're new here. You've done a lot, seen a lot. And I know Hawthorne can be a bit rough around the edges, eh? But listen to her. What she says is sound: \"Look out for each other. Don't do anything stupid. Pitch in where you can.\" She's not claiming to be one of your Vanguard. She is simply doing what she feels is her duty—defending those under her protection until all are safe and we can rebuild what we've lost.",
