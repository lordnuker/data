But every power is finite, every life shorter than it wishes. \n\nOnly an astonishing mind can truly appreciate just how tiny it is when set against the known universe; and how insignificant the known becomes when it is devoured by what isn't seen and can't be comprehended. \n\nAs darkness begins to claim their ragged souls, you look ahead to find a great power pouring out of youâ€”a face of fire and golden light. \n\nThat blazing wonder, a gift from the great-eyed god, is their salvation. Or are you? \nPerhaps you are the greater god now.",
