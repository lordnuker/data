But it's more than just a reminder of the green flames behind my brow.\n\nAsher, I saw a throne world built for the Light. Built with Darkness, of course, and the bitter logic of swords. But built for Light.\n\nIt made me wonder.\n\nThis will be my last letter for a long while. The Queen needs me more than the City does. And I need her. When she looks at me, she does not see an invalid, or a madwoman, or a burden.\n\nShe sees a Hunter.\n\nShe has pointed me at the true enemy, and with her help, I will see my quarry caught.\n\nClarity in action,\nEris Morn",
