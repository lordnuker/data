Since all of the other elements of the suit allow for equal bi-directional data transmission, modification to the architecture of the accompanying elements should prove minimal. This will free our users to be more mobile and not be concerned about damaging the main unit while taking fire. Early testing notes a marked improvement in user satisfaction.\"\n\nâ€”BrayTech Internal Memo",
