You remember your many lives since then.\n\nBut were they really you?\n\nBecause you died. You die. All the time.\n\nHow do you know that's not a whole new Hunter climbing out of that crater?\n\nWhat if those other Hunters, those other you, are still dead?\n\nDo you care? Do they?\n\nYour vision gradually returnsâ€¦\n\nA harsh glare blooms from the heavens above.\n\nSomething grips your hands, desperately shaking them.\n\nYour feet find purchase in shifting sands.\n\nYour cloak billows in the wind, yet something clings to it, weighing it down.",
