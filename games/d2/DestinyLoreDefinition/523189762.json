Push me down a hill and maybe—maybe—I'll get moving half as fast as these other guys here, if I'm lucky. I'm flattered and all, and yeah, I've always wanted to do something like this. I mean, who wouldn't, you know? Live out that high-class thief-in-the night fantasy. Disguises. Fancy parties. Steal the old man's jewels. I one hundred percent get it.
