        "description": "The driving bass line of a classic song from Old Earth drove their prey before them. No less than a half-dozen wyverns snarled and clawed at the trio as they stabbed and blasted their way through the wilds of Mars.\n\nPraedyth wished hard. Wished it would never end.\n\nAlongside him, Kabr was a towering giant. An Awoken-made weapon roared in his hands and in his head.\n\nPahanin was a force, a living embodiment of the Void. Where he pointed, Ahamkhara died.\n\nIn the middle, between them, Praedyth smiled. A winged and scaled lion with a boar's tusks leapt at him, and he could swear he saw the thing wink at him as he tore it apart.\n\nBeneath the song, Praedyth heard static, like a comm signal. Best not to think about it.\n\nPraedyth wished again, and the hunt went on.",
