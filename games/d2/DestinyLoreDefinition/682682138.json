I'm sure of it.\" Ghost cleared his throat.\n\n\"Report ALPHA SIX FOUR BLUE PHI. Visual inspection and scans at Mount Esja confirmed the debris came from the Reef.\" He paused.\n\n\"We attempted communication with Awoken allies. Signals to the Queen's Wrath, the Trials beacon, and even intel source GREENRAVEN went unanswered.\"\n\nHe sighed. \"That likely attracted the enemy attention that followed. For the record, I'll take the blame—trying to call Petra was my idea.\"\n\n\"The site was under observation by remnants of the House of Winter. Unlike many of the Fallen we've seen lately, they bore the crests and colors from one of the original Eliksni factions. They were starving and desperate. But none of them tried to flee.\"\n\nGhost let the words hang in the air for a moment. \"Returning to the Tower for a debrief.\"\n\nThey flew in silence for a long moment before Ghost activated the comms again—and despite the static, spoke into the void. \"Tower Approach, this is City Hawk 7-2-3, please respond.\"",
