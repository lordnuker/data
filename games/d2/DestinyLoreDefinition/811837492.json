How can I help you today?]\n\n\"I need to take down a giant space rhino before he sees me.\"\n\n[I assume you're referring to a Cabal enemy. Can you provide me with any more information?]\n\n\"He looks like a fifteen-foot-tall spiky cloud with wings and a cape.\"\n\n[That doesn't align with reference images I have on file. Is he wearing some kind of special armor?]\n\n\"Either that or he's got a real weird body. We're talking weirder than usual.\"\n\n[How can I help you today?]\n\n\"Sorry. Sorry. So we need to kill this Ghaul guy. I need ideas. How did that one fireteam take down Crota again?\"\n\n[They infiltrated the Ascendant Realm and confronted him at his Oversoul throne.]\n\n\"OK, that's probably not gonna work here. What about Skolas?\"\n\n[Please specify: when he met his execution in the Prison of Elders—]\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n[—or when he brought his House of Wolves across time through Vex time gates—]\n\n\"Now we're talking! Vex stuff. Teleporting. How do I do that?\"",
