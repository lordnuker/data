		"description": "A Dark Age drifter stood against an oncoming horde. The stuff of nightmares. Quad-armed, mouths full of shining carnivore teeth, carrying weathered but fully functional armor and weapons. They moved as a mob, their boots kicking up clouds of dust as they advanced, blades glinting in the sun.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, a quiet salute to his dance partners as he wove around sizzling Arc bolts, coat trailing him like a shadow. He might not walk away from this. But they definitely wouldn't.\n\nHis Machine Gun spoke much louder than he did, over and over.\n\nHe had never brought himself to shoot a human. Or anything even resembling a human. Risen included.\n\nBut these were no Risen. No humans.\n\nHe broke their advance like oil parting water, the repeating bloom of his heavy leading the way. A blue, viscous film covered the dirt, dust, and rocks when he was finished.\n\n\"All right,\" he said, looking appreciably down at his smoking weapon. A trail of spent shells traced his path through his opponents' ranks.\n\nHard to find a bite out here, most days.\n\nEvery day.\n\nHe wondered what they'd taste like.",
