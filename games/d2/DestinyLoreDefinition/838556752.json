You can't hold it, squeeze it, or put it in your pocket. It's intangible.\n\n\"You have to believe in it. I don't know about you, but I don't care much for fairy tales. I like real things that I can feel.\n\n\"This isn't to say I haven't used trust before. To get close. Close enough to use something real, that I can hold, squeeze, and tear 'em down to pocket size with.\n\n\"Up to you what you do with trust. We all have choices to make.\"\n\n—The Drifter",
