He watched for activity. Nothing yet.\n\n\"Tai, we see you,\" the voice on the radio came back. \"About twelve klicks to the rendezvous point.\"\n\nThe Titan accelerated, staying low. He was picking up a pair of Guardians—two more just like him who had been passing information to an offworld ship when their vehicle was destroyed. Just a few weeks ago, he would have scoffed at putting three people on a Sparrow. Now pickups like this were almost normal.\n\nA large Legion ship—he didn't know what kind—lay strewn across his path. He pulled back on the stick to rise over the wreck, but something within the Sparrow sputtered.\n\nA second later, that something caught fire.\n\nNo no—\n\nThe Sparrow slammed down onto the cratered road. Plasma bolts flew past Tai. Ambush.\n\nTai leapt off the Wayfarer Z and ducked behind it, firing as a platoon of Red Legion emerged from the wreck. He managed to get two before the Sparrow exploded.",
