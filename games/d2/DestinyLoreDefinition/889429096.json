That was the deal.\n\nVale: And you go forth with no regrets?\n\nCallum: We have riled the foolish and set the trap. If my end is the means by which we can ensure a generation of those whom the shadows would corrupt are removed from the playing field, then my end is welcome.\n\nVale: Braver words have never been spoken.\n\nCallum: And Paola?\n\nVale: Your Ghost understands as well as you. She is safe now, with Bane, given a new shell and… sad… but aware of what is at stake.\n\nCallum: Whose Ghost was this?\n\nVale: Unknown. A dead thing wrapped in your familiar's carcass. Simply play your part, stab the thing, and when you are gone, I will plant the audio to set you as the martyr and myself as the villain.\n\nCallum: And what if they discover Malphur and Orsa are one and the same?\n\nVale: They will not.\n\nCallum: Then onward, right?\n\nVale: Ever.\n\nCallum: It's been an honor.\n\nVale: The honor is now, has ever been, and will always be… mine.\n\nCallum: Too kind. Go well, friend.\n\nVale: I will, brother. RTL.",
