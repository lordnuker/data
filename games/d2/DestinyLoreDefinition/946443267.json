I peer out over the rock's edge—they seem to have lost me in the scuffle.\n\n\"The gentle hum begins, and I feel my weapon charging between my hands. I take out two with the first shot. Another two with the next. They scatter now, confused and irate. They seek me out desperately. All I can offer is another barrage that depletes their numbers and creates more scrap. The last two couldn't get within ten meters of me. It's a small victory, and I am alone once more.    \n\n\"It helps to set boundaries.\"\n\n—Saint-14",
