		"description": "The unenlightened wonder at my so-called \"fixation\" upon the Vex. They believe our gravest existential threat is the Hive, for those beings have made a pact with the Darkness itself via the medium of the Worm Gods (according to Toland, at least, and I see no reason to doubt him in this).\n\nBut Darkness is not merely absence of Light. Darkness is an entity unto itself. Put simply, Darkness is not Nothing.\n\nBut the Vex? The Vex seek neither Light nor Darkness. They seek Convergence, the reduction of all life to its simplest, most meaningless form. An entelechy of zeros and ones.\n\n\"Evil\" is a word for sentimentalists and fools. But, in the ontology of the sentimental, the Vex are more deserving of the term than the Hive.\n\nGiven a choice between Darkness and Convergence, I would choose Darkness. It is a logical choice.\n\nYet for this they banish me.",
